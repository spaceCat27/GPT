# GPT 
This repository contains an implementation of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture along with a small
dataset containing songs by the Polish singer Krzysztof Krawczyk. 
The purpose of this project is to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of the GPT architecture in performing text generation tasks, particularly in the domain of song lyrics.
